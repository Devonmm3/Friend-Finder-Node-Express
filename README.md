# Friend-Finder-Node-Express

This app offers the user a survey to match with an array of friends and finds the best match.  It uses Node, and Express with JS and jQuery and makes a call to the ajax.  I created the data for each friend in the array and used stock photos of models for each entry.  npm install is required for the path and express packages.
